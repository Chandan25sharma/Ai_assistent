# Alwrity Prompts Directory

Welcome to the Alwrity Prompts directory! This folder contains the LLM prompts used by Alwrity AI writers. 
By editing these prompts, you can customize the output of the AI to better suit your specific needs.

## Overview

1. **Purpose**: This directory provides an easy way to modify prompts for your use cases without hard-coding them into the main code.
2. **Intuitive Naming**: Each prompt file is named intuitively to help you identify which one to edit. If you're unsure, refer to the log messages when Alwrity executes.

## Instructions

### Important Guidelines

- **Do Not Modify Variables**: Do not change the `{}` strings and other variable names inside the prompts. These placeholders are crucial for the AI to generate the correct output.
- **Do Not Rename Files**: Keep the file names unchanged to ensure the system can locate and use them correctly.
- **Maintain YAML Structure**: Follow the YAML file structure to avoid errors. Incorrect formatting can cause the AI to malfunction.

### How to Edit Prompts

1. **Open the YAML File**: Locate and open the prompt file you wish to edit. For example, `long_form.prompts.yaml`.

2. **Modify Prompt Content**: Update the text within the prompts as needed. Be careful to retain the overall YAML structure and placeholders.

3. **Save Changes**: After making your edits, save the file.

**Different language models may require different prompting strategies. The quality of the content generated by the AI is directly influenced by the quality of the prompts you provide.**
